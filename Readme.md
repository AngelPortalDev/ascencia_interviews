We will use :



Document Verification:
For extract text:
EasyOCR
pytesseract
Textract

For classification
spaCy
Transformers (BERT)






Video Recording & Processing:
1) opencv-python: For capturing video feed from the webcam.
2) Integrate WebRTC for real-time video streaming and interaction.






Sentiment Analysis and Facial:
1) transformers (Hugging Face): Use large pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa for text sentiment analysis with higher accuracy.



Other Options:
1) mediapipe: For facial landmarks and facial expression tracking.





Face, Text & Answer Analysis : 
1) Transformers (Hugging Face) library for Sentiment analysis 7 Text answer review.


Other Option :
1) Sentence-BERT: Measure semantic similarity between a student's answer and the model/correct answer.
2) nltk or spaCy: For linguistic feature extraction and grammar checking.
3) ROUGE or BLEU Metrics: Evaluate the similarity between expected and actual responses for structured answers.


For runtime approach:
TensorFlow or PyTorch: Use pre-trained or fine-tuned models for both facial and text analysis.

Database 

PostgreSQL

API:
Celery: Api processing in background
Django REST Framework (DRF): For creating APIs that interact with the AI models and frontend.
